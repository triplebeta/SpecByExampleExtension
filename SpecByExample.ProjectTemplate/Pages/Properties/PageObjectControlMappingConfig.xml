    Use the controlTypes to register your controls with the wizard. By default, this list includes only the standard
    controls included in the installer but you may extend this list by adding your custom controls to it.
    Attributes:
      type      Classname of your control. Prefix it with its namespace when the custom control is located not a standard control and it's not in the Controls subdirectory of your Common project.
      basedOn   Kind of HTML control wrapped by this custom control. Must be an item of the enum HtmlControlTypeEnum.
      xPath     Should define an query returning a set of HTML elements.
      suffix    Optional. When omitted, the Type will be used as the suffix to append to the fieldname in the generated class, otherwise it will use this suffix.
