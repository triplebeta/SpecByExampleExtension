    <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
    <p>
        You successfully created a solution consisting of 3 projects to help you testing web applications with <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org">Selenium</a>
        and <a href="http://specificationbyexample.com/">Specification by Example</a> techniques using <a href="http://www.specflow.org">SpecFlow</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Complete the following steps to get started:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on the solution</li>
            <li>Chose to Restore NuGet Packages</li>
            <li>Build the solution to see that it's all working</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then you are ready to start the real work: adding code to test your first web page.<br />
        As an example we will test the <a href="http://www.google.com">Google homepage</a>.
        <ol>
            <li>Expand the Pages project and right-click on the ModuleA folder</li>
            <li>Chose Add &gt; New item &gt; SpecByExample PageObject</li>
            <li>As a name you just enter Google and press Enter</li>
            <li>In the next wizard you enter the url: www.google.com  and click Next</li>
            <li>For the next 3 steps you just accept the defaults by clicking Next</li>
            <li>On the last Wizard page you select both checkboxes to create a SpecFlow Steps and Features file.</li>
            <li>Click Finish to close the Wizard</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        A set of new files is now created in your project:
        <ul>
            <li>The Pages project contains a new file called GooglePage.cs containing the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">PageObject</a> implementation for automating the Google homepage.</li>
            <li>In the Specs project a similar folder ModuleA is created</li>
            <li>Within that folder a specs file is created with GoogleFeature.feature with an example of a scenario (executable as a unit test)</li>
            <li>And a file GoogleSteps.cs implementating the Given/When/Then steps to arrange, act and assert.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The proof of the pudding is to build the project, reopen the Test Explorer and run MyFirstTest.<br/>
        This should open a web browser, go to Google, then click a random link and check the navigation actually occurred.
    </p>
    <p>This extension can be found under Tools > Extensions and Updates and is named "Specification By Example Extension".</p>
